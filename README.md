# Credit Card Manager

#### by Horton Lai

### What will the application do?

My Credit Card Manager streamlines the management of multiple credit cards. Whenever users sign up for a new credit 
card to exploit promotion benefits, the credit card may be added to my manager. The application facilitates checking
of details and end dates to assist users in:
- Evaluating *which credit cards maximize their financial gains* for a specific purchase, and
- Determining *when to cancel credit cards* when the benefits are no longer in effect.

### Who will use it?

Anyone who uses credit cards regularly will benefit from my elegant solution.

### Why is this project of interest to you?

Personal finance management is crucial in life. While users are enticed with numerous credit card sign-up bonuses and 
special offers, comparing promotion details and monitoring end dates are often difficult. With my credit card manager,
users will be reaping these financial benefits without a hitch.
